## 🌟 **Key GitHub Showcase Features**

### **📋 Human-Readable Explanations**
```
"Transaction 12345 has been flagged as high-risk fraud with 87% confidence. 
Key risk factors include unusually high transaction amount and multiple 
connections to other flagged accounts. The low account age and suspicious 
location further increase the risk score."
```

### **🔧 Production API Usage**
```bash
# Start explainability server
python -m src.explainability.api --model_path model.pt --port 5000

# Get real-time explanation
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/explain -d '{"node_id": 12345}'
```

### **💻 CLI Automation**
```bash
# Batch explanations
python -m src.explainability.integration \
    --model fraud_model.pt \
    --data graph_data.pt \
    --node_ids 1,2,3,4,5 \
    --output reports/
```

### **📊 Visual Network Analysis**
- Interactive k-hop ego graphs showing fraud connections
- Feature importance rankings with visual bars
