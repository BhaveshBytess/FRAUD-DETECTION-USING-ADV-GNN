## Phase C - Demo Notebook & Demo Artifacts
**Status: ✅ COMPLETED**

### Commands Executed:
1. Created `notebooks/demo.ipynb` with full local demo pipeline
2. Created `scripts/collect_demo_artifacts.py` for automated demo execution
3. Tested demo script: `python scripts/collect_demo_artifacts.py --out experiments/demo/test_run_final`
   - **Log:** `experiments/stage13/logs/phase_c_demo_final.log`
   - **Outcome:** SUCCESS - Generated preds.csv, explanations HTML, and metrics.json

### Files Created/Updated:

- Demo script generates required artifacts (preds.csv + explanation HTMLs)
- Timestamped directory structure working correctly
- Ready for Phase D implementation

## Phase D - Results Summary PDF & Figures
**Status: ✅ COMPLETED**

### Commands Executed:
1. Created `notebooks/generate_report.ipynb` - Interactive report generation notebook
2. Created `scripts/generate_report_clean.py` - Command-line PDF generation script
3. Tested PDF generation: `python scripts/generate_report_clean.py`
   - **Log:** `experiments/stage13/logs/phase_d_clean_test.log`
   - **Outcome:** SUCCESS - Generated 3-page PDF (0.05 MB) with architecture and performance plots

### Files Created/Updated:
- ✅ `notebooks/generate_report.ipynb` - Complete interactive report generation
- ✅ `scripts/generate_report_clean.py` - Working command-line PDF generator
- ✅ `scripts/generate_report.py` - Main script (redirects to clean version)
- ✅ `reports/results_summary.pdf` - Generated 3-page professional report with:
  - Executive summary and elevator pitch
  - Technical specifications and key achievements
  - Architecture pipeline diagram
  - Performance comparison and scalability plots
