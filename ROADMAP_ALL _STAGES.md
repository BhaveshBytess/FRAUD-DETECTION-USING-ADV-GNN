Perfect — below is the **complete, master stage breakdown** for the entire hHGTN project. I used a reasoning-first approach: each stage has a clear objective, why it’s ordered there, exact tasks, expected artifacts, acceptance checks, and notes about compute / research-paper needs. This is the canonical roadmap we’ll follow; later we’ll expand any stage into a detailed step-by-step implementation using the First-Principles Framework.

# 📂 Master Stage Roadmap — hHGTN (Full, everything-included)

---

## Stage 0 — Project Setup & Dataset Finalization (ground truth)

**Objective:** Lock dataset(s), repo structure, runtime targets, and minimal reproducible environment so every stage plugs in cleanly.  
**Why first:** Everything else depends on what dataset(s) and environment we commit to.

**Tasks**

- Finalize primary dataset → **Elliptic++** (graph-native). Decide optional secondary (e.g., Kaggle/IEEE transactions) for tabular→graph conversion.
    
- Create repo skeleton (notebooks/, src/, data/, experiments/, docs/).
    
- Create `requirements.txt` / Colab + Kaggle environment cell.
    
- Define compute policy: which parts run on Kaggle, which on Colab, which locally.
    
- Collect/annotate any required papers you want implemented exactly (CUSP, TRDG, SpotTarget if available).
    

**Artifacts**

- Repo skeleton, env cell, dataset pointers, dataset card with reasons and quick stats.
    

**Acceptance checks**

- Can load a tiny Elliptic++ sample into a PyG `HeteroData` object.
    
- Repo scaffolding visible and reproducible in Colab.
    

**Notes**

- You don’t _need_ RDB for Elliptic++; optional later if converting tabular datasets.

## Stage 1 — Data Exploration & Graph Preprocessing (full graph hygiene)

**Objective:** Inspect graph(s), compute summary stats, create test/val/train temporal splits and leakage checks.

**Why now:** Models must train on leakage-safe splits; temporal splits especially critical for fraud.

**Tasks**

- Full EDA: node & edge counts by type, degree distributions, time-step histograms.
    
- Define canonical schema for our project (node types, edge types, features).
    
- Implement time-safe chronological splitting (train < val < test by time).
    
- Implement small “sample” datasets for fast iteration (lite mode).
    
- If using tabular secondary dataset: draft SQL/ETL plan (RDB ingestion optional).
    

**Artifacts**

- dataset_card.md (schema, splits, leakage analysis), small parquet node/edge dumps, EDA notebook.
    

**Acceptance checks**

- Temporal split code runs and shows no future leakage (neighbor stat check).
    
- Small sample run completes in < a few minutes on Colab.
    

---

## Stage 2 — Baseline Models & Sanity Metrics

**Objective:** Implement simple baselines so we have performance & engineering baselines.

**Why:** Rapid feedback loop — detect data bugs and provide metrics to justify later model complexity.

**Methods included**

- GCN, GAT, GraphSAGE (homogeneous).
    
- Tabular baseline (XGBoost on row features) if applicable.
    

**Tasks**

- Implement model training loop (`train.py`) with configurable hyperparams.
    
- Implement evaluation (AUC, PR-AUC, Precision@k, F1, Recall).
    
- Log runtime & GPU memory usage (basic profiling).
    

**Artifacts**

- Baseline notebooks, `models/baseline.py`, metrics.json.
    

**Acceptance checks**

- Baseline models train and produce plausible metrics; logs saved to experiments/.
    

---

## Stage 3 — Relational / Heterogeneous Models

**Objective:** Model multiple node/edge types (R-GCN, HGT, HAN) and compare to baselines.

**Why:** Fraud requires entity-type aware message passing; hetero models are first lift-up from simple GCN.

**Methods included**

- R-GCN, HGT (Heterogeneous Graph Transformer), HAN.
    
- Hybrid: node-type specific MLP heads.
    

**Tasks**

- Implement hetero data loaders (`HeteroData` / DGL heterograph).
    
- Implement R-GCN & HGT training modules (config flags `--use-hetero`).
    
- Validate per-type losses & per-type metrics.
    

**Artifacts**

- `models/hetero.py`, hetero notebooks, per-type confusion matrices.
    

**Acceptance checks**

- Hetero models run stable and outperform (or at least are comparable) to homogeneous baselines on hetero-aware metrics.
    

---

## Stage 4 — Temporal Modeling (Memory-based TGNNs)

**Objective:** Add temporal dynamics: TGN/TGAT and memory modules that maintain node state over events.

**Why:** Fraud evolves; temporal memory improves detection and prevents leakage if done correctly.

**Methods included**

- TGAT, TGN (memory modules), DyRep/JODIE variants (if needed).
    

**Tasks**

- Implement time-ordered event loader and neighbor sampling respecting time.
    
- Implement memory update pipeline (message → memory update → embedding).
    
- Add time-aware evaluation (metrics per time window), drift analysis.
    

**Artifacts**

- `models/temporal.py`, temporal evaluation notebooks, memory state visualization.
    

**Acceptance checks**

- Temporal models train without time-leakage, and show stable or improved metrics vs Stage 3 on temporal test splits.
    

**Notes**

- This stage is dependent on Stage 1 temporal splits and Stage 3 hetero loaders (we will reuse).
    

---

## Stage 5 — Higher-Order / Hypergraph Modeling

**Objective:** Model transactions as hyperedges linking multiple entities (user, merchant, device, IP).

**Why:** Many fraud patterns are multi-entity collusion — hypergraphs capture motifs missed by pairwise GNNs.

**Methods included**

- HypergraphConv, HGNN-style layers; combined hypergraph↔graph transforms.
    

**Tasks**

- Construct hyperedge representation from dataset (if using Elliptic++ create hyperviews or synthetic hyperedges).
    
- Implement hypergraph layer and hybrid pipelines: hyperconv → hetero conv.
    
- Evaluate contribution of hyperedges via ablation: with/without hyperedges.
    

**Artifacts**

- `models/hypergraph.py`, hyperedge construction scripts, ablation results.
    

**Acceptance checks**

- Hypergraph model shows improved detection on cases involving multi-entity events.
    

---

## Stage 6 — Sampling & Efficiency (TRDGNN-inspired + gSampler ideas)

**Objective:** Implement the efficient, time-relaxed neighborhood sampler and a GPU-friendly ECSF approach inspired by gSampler.

**Why:** Sampling dominates training time and must be leakage-safe and efficient for Colab/Kaggle.

**Methods included**

- TRDGNN-inspired time-relaxed sampling (Δt window), ECSF-style matrix ops, neighbor sampling (GraphSAGE/NeighborLoader).
    
- gSampler ideas -> matrix-centric Extract-Compute-Select-Finalize pattern (implementation approximation).
    

**Tasks**

- Design & implement `sampler.py` with flags: `--delta-t`, `--time-relaxed`, `--fanout`.
    
- Replace naive Python loops with batched matrix ops where possible.
    
- Profile sampling time and iterate.
    

**Artifacts**

- `src/sampler.py`, sampling benchmarks, profiling reports.
    

**Acceptance checks**

- Sampling stage reduces sampling time significantly for our pipeline (practical improvement vs naive).
    
- Sampling respects temporal Δt and prevents label leakage.
    

**Notes**

- If user provides gSampler paper/pseudocode, we will adapt more faithfully; otherwise we create a principled matrix-centric sampler.
    

---

## Stage 7 — Training Discipline & Robustness (SpotTarget + RGNN defenses)

**Objective:** Implement SpotTarget (leakage-safe training discipline) and robustness techniques (RGNN, DropEdge, regularization).

**Why:** Prevent overfitting/label leakage and make the model robust to adversarial/noisy inputs.

**Methods included**

- SpotTarget wrapper (remove target edges, low-degree node rules).
    
- RGNN robustness layers / adversarial defenses, DropEdge, early stopping.
    
- Imbalance handling: class weights, focal loss, GraphSMOTE.
    

**Tasks**

- Implement `training_wrapper.spottarget()` that transforms mini-batches to remove target edges.
    
- Implement robustness modules + ablation tests.
    

**Artifacts**

- `src/spot_target.py`, `src/robustness.py`, experiments showing effect of SpotTarget.
    

**Acceptance checks**

- Models with SpotTarget show reduced leakage artifacts (validate via leakage detection tests).
    
- Robustness modules do not catastrophically worsen base performance.
    

---

## Stage 8 — Curved / Spectro-Riemannian Embeddings (CUSP)

**Objective:** Implement CUSP-style embedding strategy — mix Euclidean, Hyperbolic, Spherical representations and spectral filtering approximations.

**Why:** Scale-free, hierarchical relationships in fraud networks can be better represented in non-Euclidean spaces.

**Methods included**

- Use `geoopt` / `torch-hyperbolic` for hyperbolic layers, learnable curvature parameters, spectral prefiltering (approximation if paper lacks code).
    
- Concatenation / gating between manifold embeddings.
    

**Tasks**

- Implement manifold embedding wrappers (`src/embeddings/cusp.py`).
    
- Train gated fusion of Euclidean + hyperbolic embeddings.
    
- Ablation: Euclidean vs hyperbolic vs fused.
    

**Artifacts**

- `models/cusp.py`, manifold debug visualizations (Poincaré plots), ablation table.
    

**Acceptance checks**

- CUSP fused embeddings show improved structure-sensitive metrics (e.g., better recall on hierarchical fraud rings) or at least not worse than Euclidean baseline.
    

**Notes**

- If we need exact spectral formulas from paper, please paste key equations/pseudocode; otherwise we do a principled engineering variant.
    

---

## Stage 9 — Full Integration: hHGTN Pipeline

**Objective:** Combine HypergraphConv + HGT/R-GCN layers + TGN memory + CUSP embeddings + TRD sampler + SpotTarget into the final hHGTN model.

**Why:** This is the end-goal architecture that demonstrates everything you promised.

**Tasks**

- Create modular `hHGTN` class with config flags for each submodule (so we can toggle pieces).
    
- Implement training & evaluation harness supporting ablation runs.
    
- Save model checkpoints and standardized logs.
    

**Artifacts**

- `models/hhgn.py` (or `models/hhgt.py`), integrated notebook with full end-to-end training recipe.
    

**Acceptance checks**

- Model runs end-to-end in full or lite mode on Colab.
    
- Checkpointing and resume works.
    

---

## Stage 10 — Explainability & Interpretability

**Objective:** Add GNNExplainer / PGExplainer and design interpretability visualizations for flagged fraud instances.

**Why:** Explainability is critical for recruiter/interviewer traction and real-world trust.

**Methods included**

- GNNExplainer, PGExplainer, counterfactual explanations, top-k subgraph extraction.
    

**Tasks**

- Run explainers over sample fraud predictions and visualize k-hop ego graphs highlighting influential nodes/edges.
    
- Create human-readable reports: “Why transaction X was flagged — top contributing features & nodes.”
    

**Artifacts**

- `notebooks/explainability.ipynb`, explainer visualizations, HTML reports.
    

**Acceptance checks**

- Explainer outputs sensible subgraphs; explanations are reproducible and saved.
    

---

## Stage 11 — Systematic Benchmarking (4DBFinfer / GNNBench)

**Objective:** Rigorously benchmark all models (GCN, R-GCN, TGN, HGNN, hHGTN) with standardized metrics: predictive performance, runtime, GPU memory, scalability.

**Why:** Adds engineering rigor and a strong resume claim that we benchmarked systematically.

**Methods included**

- Integrate GNNBench/4DBFinfer-style metrics and measurement: runtime, memory, throughput, accuracy, PR-AUC, Recall@k.
    
- Compare lite vs full modes and record ablation tables.
    

**Tasks**

- Implement benchmarking harness that runs models under identical conditions and logs memory & time.
    
- Produce a benchmarking report with charts & concise interpretation.
    

**Artifacts**

- `benchmarks/4dbfinfer_report.md`, charts, csvs with metrics, reproducible benchmark notebook.
    

**Acceptance checks**

- Benchmarks reproducible on Colab/Kaggle; reports generated and summarized.
    

---

## Stage 12 — Ablations, Robustness Tests & Scalability

**Objective:** Run targeted ablations to show contribution of each module and scalability experiments (neighbor sampling, mini-batching).

**Why:** Interviewers love ablation studies; they show you understand what actually helps.

**Tasks**

- Ablation matrix (turn off CUSP, turn off hypergraph, turn off memory, etc.).
    
- Scalability tests: increase graph size (subsampling), measure runtime & memory.
    
- Adversarial / drift tests: simulate distribution shift and test temporal robustness.
    

**Artifacts**

- Ablation tables, scalability plots, README section with takeaways.
    

**Acceptance checks**

- Clear ablation summary that justifies the full design choices.
    

---

## Stage 13 — Packaging, Reproducibility & Resume Deliverables

**Objective:** Prepare final repo, polished notebooks, README, two-sentence project pitch, and resume-ready artifacts.

**Why:** This is the deliverable recruiters will read.

**Tasks**

- Add `HOWTO` quickstart notebook (run in Colab with one click).
    
- Add `results_summary.pdf` with key plots & tables.
    
- Write concise resume bullet and README highlights.
    
- Add small `demo.ipynb` that runs inference on example transactions and shows explanations.
    

**Artifacts**

- Final repo, Colab links, README, results PDF, resume bullet.
    

**Acceptance checks**

- One-click run reproduces key result on Colab in lite mode and produces explanation output.
    

---

## Stage 14 — (Optional) Deployment & Demo

**Objective:** Lightweight deploy (Flask/FastAPI) to demo an explainable fraud check endpoint; or make static interactive demo notebook.

**Why:** Great demo in interviews but optional given time/compute.

**Tasks**

- Build inference endpoint that loads model weights and returns top-k explanation graph for a transaction.
    
- Dockerize if wanted.
    

**Artifacts**

- `demo_service/`, minimal UI or API spec.
    

**Acceptance checks**

- Demo endpoint responds with predictions and explanation subgraph.
    

---

## Cross-Stage Considerations & Conventions

- **Modularity:** Every model must be togglable via config flags. (`--use-hypergraph`, `--use-cusp`, etc.)
    
- **Lite vs Full Modes:** Each stage will have `mode=lite` (subsampled, fast, Colab-friendly) and `mode=full` (deeper experiments).
    
- **Reproducibility:** Seeds, dataset card, and `requirements.txt` included.
    
- **Papers / Fidelity:** For highly novel modules (CUSP, TRDG exact variant, SpotTarget exact), please paste key equations/pseudocode where fidelity matters. I will implement principled engineering approximations if paper details are missing, but will mark deviations.
    
- **Testing:** Each stage ends with acceptance checks to avoid compounding mistakes.
    
- **Benchmarks:** 4DBFinfer integration occurs after our final model stage but small benchmarking will run after earlier stages to monitor improvements.

## Final Reasoning for Ordering (short)

1. Data & infra first — everything depends on it.
    
2. Baselines early — detect dataset issues fast and create measurable gains.
    
3. Hetero → Temporal → Hypergraph follows increasing modeling complexity while reusing prior data loaders.
    
4. Sampler & training discipline before final integration — they affect whether the large integrated model can train practically.
    
5. CUSP embeddings and explainability are added prior to final integration and benchmark to show added value.
    
6. Benchmarking (4DBFinfer) last to quantify tradeoffs and produce recruiter-friendly results.
