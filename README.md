# HHGTN Project

This project is a template for building Heterogeneous Graph Transformer Networks.

## Data

* The full dataset (e.g., Elliptic++) should be placed in `data/ellipticpp/`.
* Sample data for testing is located in `data/sample/`.

Expected filenames:
* `data/ellipticpp/nodes.csv`
* `data/ellipticpp/edges.csv`
